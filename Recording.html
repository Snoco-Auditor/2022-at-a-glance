		  <div style="margin-left:15%;"><h4>Total Documents Recorded</h4>
			<p style="font-size:1.075em;">Due to historically low interest rates, a record number of real estate related documents were recorded in 2020 and 2021. But rising national interest rates and an uncertain housing market in 2022 meant Snohomish County Recording experienced a noticeable decrease in the number of documents recorded.</p>
